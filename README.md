# Morlet-signal-analysis
## Introduction
To analyze the temporal evolution of spectral signatures in fluctuating flow fields, the **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)** is utilized. This transformative approach decomposes a signal into highly localized wavelets, enabling detailed inspection in both time and frequency domains [1, 2]. By employing **complex Morlet wavelets**, the method provides a powerful representation of time-frequency dynamics. The **Morlet wavelet**, characterized by the modulation of a Gaussian envelope with a complex sinusoidal function, is particularly well-suited for analyzing non-stationary signals with varying spectral content.

### Key Features of CWT:
1. **Time-Frequency Localization**: Wavelets allow for the simultaneous analysis of time and frequency components, capturing transient features in the data.
2. **Scalability**: The method accommodates both single-frequency and multi-frequency analyses.
3. **Robust Convolution Framework**: Using frequency-domain convolution, the method ensures computational efficiency while preserving signal fidelity.

### Morlet Wavelet Definition
The Morlet wavelet function \( \psi(t) \) is defined as:
\[
\psi(t) = e^{2 \pi i f_w t} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2 \sigma^2}}
\]
where:
- \( f_w \): Center frequency of the wavelet.
- \( \sigma \): Standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope, determined by the number of cycles (\( n_{\text{cycles}} \)) as:
\[
\sigma = \frac{n_{\text{cycles}}}{2 \pi f_w}
\]

### Key Equations
1. **Frequency-Domain Convolution**:
   \[
   \text{conv}(f) = \mathcal{F}(\text{signal}) \cdot \mathcal{F}(\psi)
   \]
   where \( \mathcal{F} \) denotes the Fourier transform.

2. **Reconstructed Signal**:
   \[
   \text{signal}_{\text{filtered}} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\text{conv}(f))
   \]
   where \( \mathcal{F}^{-1} \) is the inverse Fourier transform.

3. **Normalization**:
   To preserve the amplitude integrity, the wavelet's Fourier transform is normalized as:
   \[
   \mathcal{F}(\psi) \leftarrow \frac{\mathcal{F}(\psi)}{\max(\mathcal{F}(\psi))}
   \]

### Example Usage
The library includes implementations for:
- **Single-Frequency Analysis**: Focused wavelet transform at a specific frequency.
- **Multi-Frequency Analysis**: Computation of the time-frequency representation for a range of frequencies.
- **Diagnostic Plots**: Visualization of original, filtered, and reconstructed signals, along with frequency-domain representations.

## Installation
Simply include the `wavelet_analysis.py` file in your project and import the functions as needed:
```python
